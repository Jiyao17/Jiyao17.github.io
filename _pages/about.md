I'm currently (Apr. 2024) a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate at the Computer and Information Sciences Department at Temple University, advised by [Dr. Yu Wang](https://cis.temple.edu/~yu/){:target="_blank"}. I'm interested in research on networks and networked systems, such as networked AI systems and quantum networks. I have worked at Toyota Motor North America as a machine learning research intern during Aug. - Dec. 2023, supervised by Dr. Yongkang Liu.

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Information Security from North China University of Technology in Jun. 2020.
