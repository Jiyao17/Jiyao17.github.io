Jiyao Liu is currently (Apr. 2024) a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate at the Computer and Information Sciences Department at Temple University, advised by [Dr. Yu Wang](https://cis.temple.edu/~yu/){:target="_blank"}.  

He is interested in research on the intersections of networking and other cutting-edge technologies, especially networking + AI/quantum. For example, on networking + AI, he recently worked on federeted/distributed machine learning, and LLMs for network systems; on networking + quantum, he recently worked on quantum networks, and quantum-classic optmization for network systems.  

He has worked at Toyota Motor North America as a machine learning research intern during Aug. - Dec. 2023, supervised by Dr. Yongkang Liu.  There, he designed a model for battery prediction for electric vehicles with ~10% MAPE, which is **better than Tesla**'s.  

Prior to his Ph.D. study, he obtained his B.Eng. in Information Security from North China University of Technology in Jun. 2020.
